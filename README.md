# cs-RSA
***
## What this project is for
Rewriting my own implementation of RSA in cs in order to learn how it works.
Part of my Matura-Project examining the implications of Quantum-Computing on modern-day cryptography.

## Double-Checking Config
You can use [devglan.com](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/rsa-encryption-decryption) to double-check results with
the padding set to RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
